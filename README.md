# fuck().you

You probably all heard about OOP(Object-oriented programming), right?
Well, here's a new way to do it - object programming.
The whole program is basically just a structured object access

Wat? Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but look at this code:

    fuck({x: 5, y:10})     // initialize a fuck
        .to.z              // start expression routine and store it into z
            .x.y.add       // Use reverse-polish notation, 'cause fuck parenthesis
        .stfu              // ‘stfu’ stands for ‘Shut the fuck up’ and it stops the last routine
    .you;                  // every program stops when you access you. The return value is
                           // the context object that was created. There's only 'global' scope
                           // for now, so there's still a lot of work to do :)
                           // Here we get this object -> { x: 5, y: 10, z: 15 }



    fuck()
     .assign.x.num(5).stfu
     .func.a.b.c.do
       // this expression -> return a + b - (b - c)
       // same as -> .return.sub(sum(a, b), sub(b-c))
       // with fuck().you ->
       .return.sub.sum.a.b.sub.b.c.stfu;
       .return.sum.a.b
     .stfu
    .you;
